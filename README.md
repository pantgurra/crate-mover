# CrateMover

Solution to the day 5 challenge in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) including a simple interface written in React.

Paste your puzzle input (or use the [sample input](sampleInput.txt) provided) in the input field and load input, the crates starting positions will be visualized.

Execute the instructions to rearrange the crates and get puzzle answer to part 1 in the output.

Use the switch to change the CrateMover model to CrateMover 9001 and execute the instructions to get puzzle answer to part 2.

If you are using the sample you'll have to take my word for it that the right answer is `SPFMVDTZT ` for part one and `ZFSJBPRFP` for part two.
